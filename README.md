A practical approach to understand the basics of Computer System Design and Computer Architecture better. 

Project 1: Computer CPU simulation






Project 2: Scalar Pipelined Prcoessor Simulation
This project aims at simulating a basic scalar pipeline architecture of the CPU.

If you are working in a Linux - based system, in order to run this file, unzip the folder and open the folder in a terminal, and type
g++ main.cpp

After this, type 
./a.out

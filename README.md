This project aims at simulating a basic scalar pipeline architecture of the CPU.

If you are working in a Linux - based system, in order to run this file, unzip the folder and open the folder in a terminal, and type
g++ main.cpp

After this, type 
./a.out

After this you can access the subfolder "output" in the folder where 2 files namely "Output.txt" and "DCache.txt" are present.
These are the output files

Thank you
